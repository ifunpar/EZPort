# EZPort

EZPort exports WooCommerce orders into CSV, XLX, and XLSX complete with their meta data.

## Full Description

Some WooCommerce plugins add functionality to order items, that additional
information for each item ordered is recorded. In most cases, it will be stored
as "meta data". These information can be viewed from the admin page, but most
export plugins ignores this information. Hence, you will get the exported file
without this information.

EZPort helps you to get all information CSV/XLS/XLSX.

One example of plugin that retrieves additional information is [Woo Custom
Product Addons](https://wordpress.org/plugins/woo-custom-product-addons/).
Note that the author of this plugin is not affiliated to the author of Woo
Custom Product Addons.
